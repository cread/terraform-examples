# subnets

This example demonstrates a number of subnet architecture options. It should be
clear and easy enough to delete the types you don't need.

## subnet types

* `public` - full public subnet with internet routing
* `nat` - private subnet with NAT access to the internet
* `local` - private subnet with NO access to the internet or anything outside the VPC
